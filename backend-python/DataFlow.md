1) As you can see in json object Drugs consists of all the drugs present in a tablet, first task is to collect all the drugs present in the prescription, it means all the tablets selected by the user combined.
2) Then we will remove all the duplicates and create a list of unique drugs
3) Then this list of drugs will be processed. There is a csv file called Final_50PCA which contains the PCA of every drug, we check if the drugs present in the list are also in this file or not and remove the ones not present in csv file, this will give the final list of drugs for which we check for DDIs
4) Now with all the drugs present in the list we find all unique pairs, it means if there are N drugs in the final list there will be Nc2 pairs. Each drug pair will be constructed a input profile for prediction
5) Now the combined PCA of the drug pair is formed to construct the input profile of drug for the prediction in ML model, IT MUST STRICTLY BE DONE AS DONE IN THE REFERNCE CODE I WILL SHARE
6) after the input profiles are constructed, every pair is sent for prediction and the corresponding output label after processed into corresponding label will be the output we display to user
7) if there is  a DDI present, i.e, other than NO DDI, that will be displayed as output to user, since there maybe multiple inputs all such DDI outputs will be listed and stored and after completion of prediction of all outputs, the list is displayed to user.
This is how the flow chart of new working should be, I will now share a code which includes how input profile is created and how output is processed, in that creation of ssp, pca can be avoided as we already have PCA file ready, use that file and construct a workflow for the successfull fullfillement of all the mentioned working:
